Title: Details of (++)plussers displayed.
------------------------------
Date: 2014-05-12T18:40:17

To get a better insight of which Pause users have ++ed a particular distribution, a list of their gravatar images is displayed.
Also, the count of non-Pause plussers makes it easier to know how many users have liked the module.

Hence, it gives us a perception of the people who recommend the module.

Date: 2014-05-13T20:50:10

Jeffrey Thalhammer took the time this week to contribute dependency graphs to
MetaCPAN.  The graphs are hosted by [Stratopan](http://stratopan.com) and they
can be found on module and release pages under the "Reverse Dependencies" link.

Thanks very much to [THALJEF](https://metacpan.org/author/THALJEF) for
implementing this new feature.

In this news feed you can follow the development of the MetaCPAN site.
There is also an [Atom feed](/feed/news).

If you are interested in how the news feed itself was implemented, check out
